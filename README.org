#+TITLE:ACM SIGPLAN (May 2020) in Org-mode 9.*
#+AUTHOR: Alexander Schaap
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

The [[http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format][ACM SIGPLAN template]] in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]], just type ~make~ (after installing
=acmart.cls= in your system). Be aware that this example is compatible
with OrgMode 9.*. Earlier or later Org-mode versions may require minor
modifications to the =Makefile= and/or the Org file.  For a detailed
explanation on why and how to write reproducible articles using
Org-mode, please visit the following [[https://github.com/alegrand/RR_webinars/blob/master/1_replicable_article_laboratory_notebook/index.org][page]].

Adapted from =sample-sigplan.tex= from the [[https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-master.zip][=acmart= package]] and the
[[https://github.com/schnorr/acmorg][ACM Small template in Org-mode]] by Lucas Mello Schnorr.

Entering the remaining content of the =sample-sigplan.tex= file would
be a good exercise for the novice reader.
